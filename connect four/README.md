# connect_four
This was created as a project for our studyprogramm.
It's a very basic version of [connect four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four "Connect Four Wikipedia") it runs in python and has very few packages that aren't in your basic python distribution
all you need to run this is [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/ "numpy install") and [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted "pygame install") installed aswell as a [python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/ "python download") distribution.
We hope you enjoy this small game we made.
