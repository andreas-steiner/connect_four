# connect_four
This was created as a project for our studyprogramm.
It's a very basic version of [connect four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four "Connect Four Wikipedia") it runs in python and has very few packages that aren't in your basic python distribution
all you need to run this is numpy and pygame installed aswell as a python3 distribution.
We hope you enjoy this small game we made.
